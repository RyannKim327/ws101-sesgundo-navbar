        I am Ryann Kim Sesgundo, most people around me called Kim and other
        nicknames such as <emp>Ulan</emp>, and <emp>Kimmy</emp>. I am also the
        one behind the name of MPOP Reverse II, a small programming organization
        unit founded since 2017 and renamed last 2020. As I want to help to
        students with difficulties in learning and understanding programming, I
        am passionate in tutoring them and help them to understand a certain
        program, not just by code, but also by Logic and Context, as I believe
        that programming is not by memorizing, but understanding the process.
